Final Frontier Plus Art Assets
------------------------------

This repo contains the art assets for the Final Frontier Plus project.

Why are they in version control? Perhaps they shouldn't be, but I don't know
of a better way to organize them.

Building:
---------

For best results, you should use Firaxis's PakBuild (or another program which
knows how to create Civ4-style FPK files).

You can find PakBuild here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=136023
And a tutorial on it here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=297865

License:
--------

Final Frontier Plus is as "open source" as a mod of a proprietary video game
can get. In a nutshell that means you are welcome to use any assets (code,
art, etc.) created by Final Frontier Plus contributors in other Civilization
IV mods (or elsewhere, should you really want to).

Firaxis and 2K own Civilization 4.

"Final Frontier" is a scenario created by Jon Shafer for Civilization IV:
Beyond the Sword when he was employed by Firaxis Games.

"Final Frontier Plus" is an unofficial modification built by TC01 and God-Emperor, 
among other contributors (Please see the CREDITS.txt file in the main repo). 

None of the above parties are liable for any damages caused by any part of
Final Frontier Plus.

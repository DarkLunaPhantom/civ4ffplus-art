This leaderhead, Miranda Lawson, is an import from Mass Effect 2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2). Therefore, while slightly modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for both and all rights are with BioWare.

This leaderhead uses modified Peter animations. While this download is not modular, all files in the zip-file are put into the necessary folders to replace Peter with the Miranda model if used as mod. The model has a polycount of about 11000 triangles. There are a noshader and a shader version included.

- BioWare (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare) for creating the model
